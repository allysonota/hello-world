# hello-world
You know I had to ... hello world!
I am going through the steps of the tutorial on git hub, and had to make the hello-world repo just because. 
I live in Honolulu, Hawaiʻi and work as a librarian. One of the perks of my current position, is I get free tuition for classes in the University of Hawaiʻi system, so I am currently working towards an M.Ed. in Learning Design & Technology. So, basically, I have no life outside of work and school. :P
